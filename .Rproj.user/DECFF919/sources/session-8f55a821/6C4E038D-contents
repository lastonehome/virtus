Description: The virtus package allows for the measurement of values-based language in text. Based on the paper 'Development and Validation of the Personal Values Dictionary: A Theory-Driven Tool for Investigating References to Basic Human Values in Text' by Ponizovskiy et. al (2020).
    The package provides funcions for a basic count of word occurence as well as a function which adjusts the scores based on mdifying words (like 'very' or 'partially').
